# Connect4
This programm is a console based version of the connect4 game :
The Connect Four game is a two-player strategy game played on a board consisting of seven columns and six rows. 
Each player takes turns dropping their colored disks (either red or yellow) into the columns, with the goal of getting four of their disks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before their opponent can do so.

The console-based version of this game is a program that allows users to play the game on their computer through a command-line interface. 
The program prompts each player to input the column number where they want to drop their disk, and then displays the updated game board after each move.

The program also includes various features such as checking for winning conditions, preventing players from dropping disks into full columns, and detecting ties (when the board is completely filled without either player winning).

Overall, the program provides a simple and accessible way for users to enjoy the classic Connect Four game in a digital format.
